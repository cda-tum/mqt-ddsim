# MQT DDSIM - A quantum circuit simulator based on decision diagrams written in C++

A tool for classical quantum circuit simulation developed as part of the [_Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)_](https://mqt.readthedocs.io) by the [Chair for Design Automation](https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/) at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/).
It builds upon [MQT Core](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/core), which forms the backbone of the MQT.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us via [quantum.cda@xcit.tum.de](mailto:quantum.cda@xcit.tum.de) or by creating an [issue](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/ddsim/issues) on GitHub.

## Getting Started

DDSIM bundled with the provider and backends for Qiskit is available via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mqt.ddsim/) for Linux, macOS, and Windows and supports Python 3.9 to 3.13.

```console
(venv) $ pip install mqt.ddsim
```

The following code gives an example on the usage:

```python3
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from mqt import ddsim

circ = QuantumCircuit(3)
circ.h(0)
circ.cx(0, 1)
circ.cx(0, 2)

print(circ.draw(fold=-1))

backend = ddsim.DDSIMProvider().get_backend("qasm_simulator")

job = backend.run(circ, shots=10000)
counts = job.result().get_counts(circ)
print(counts)
```

**Detailed documentation on all available methods, options, and input formats is available at [ReadTheDocs](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/ddsim).**

## System Requirements and Building

The implementation is compatible with any C++17 compiler and a minimum CMake version of 3.19.
Please refer to the [documentation](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/ddsim) on how to build the project.

Building (and running) is continuously tested under Linux, macOS, and Windows using the [latest available system versions for GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments).
