Welcome to MQT DDSIM's documentation!
=====================================

DDSIM is a tool for quantum circuit simulation developed as part of the `Munich Quantum Toolkit <https://mqt.readthedocs.io>`_ (*MQT*) by the `Chair for Design Automation <https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/>`_ at the `Technical University of Munich <https://www.tum.de>`_. It builds upon `MQT Core <https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-core>`_, which forms the backbone of the MQT.

We recommend you to start with the :doc:`installation instructions <Installation>` and then proceed to the :doc:`quickstart guide <Quickstart>`.
If you are interested in the theory behind QCEC, have a look at the publications in the :doc:`publication list <Publications>`.

We appreciate any feedback and contributions to the project. If you want to contribute, you can find more information in the :doc:`Contribution <Contributing>` guide. If you are having trouble with the installation or the usage of DDSIM, please let us know at our :doc:`Support <Support>` page.
