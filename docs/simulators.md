# Simulators

DDSIM offers different kinds of simulators to use. The following documentation gives an overview of the different simulator
followed by brief demonstrations of the usage in Python and as standalone executable.

All simulators immediately, or with steps in between, inherit from the abstract {cpp:class}`Simulator` class that provides
basic functionality used by multiple actual simulators.
