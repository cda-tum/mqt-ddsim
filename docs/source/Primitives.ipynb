    "The existing Qiskit interface to backends (backend.run()) was originally designed to accept a list of circuits and return counts for every job. Over time, it became clear that users have diverse purposes for quantum computing, and therefore the ways in which they define the requirements for their computing jobs are expanding. \n",
    "\n",
    "To address this issue, Qiskit introduced the `qiskit.primitives` module in version 0.35.0 (Qiskit Terra 0.20.0) to provide a simplified way for end users to compute outputs of interest from a QuantumCircuit and to use backends. Qiskit's primitives provide methods that make it easier to build modular algorithms and other higher-order programs. Rather than simply returning counts, they return more immediately meaningful information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main submodules of the primitives are the `Sampler` and the `Estimator`. The first one computes quasi-probability distributions from circuit measurements, while the second one calculates and interprets expectation values of quantum operators that are required for many near-term quantum algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "MQT now provides its own version of the Qiskit primitives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Sampler` leverages the default circuit simulator based on decision diagrams, while preserving the methods and functionality of the original Qiskit's sampler.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Estimator` is currently in development and will be available soon.\n"
